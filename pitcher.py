    The water pitcher puzzle: Suppose that you are given a 3 quart
    pitcher and a 4 quart pitcher.  Either pitcher can be filled
    from a faucet.  The contents of either pitcher can be poured
    down a drain.  Water may be poured from one pitcher to the other.
    When pouring, as soon as the pitcher being poured into is full,
    the pouring stops.  There is no additional measuring device and
    and the pitchers have no markings to show partial quantities.

    Each operator returns a new instance of this class representing
    the successor state.
